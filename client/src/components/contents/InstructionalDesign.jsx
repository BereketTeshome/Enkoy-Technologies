        It takes a lot to plan, design, and create instructional content. It
        requires an exceptionally learner-focused personality. Great
        organizational skills. Someone knowledgeable in learning theory and
        principles. A high storytelling aptitude. But exceptional instructional
        design (ID) also relies on a keen eye for detail and a penchant for
        data-driven design decision-making. While everyone in the profession
        aspires to be an exceptional instructional system designer, what sets
        the “great” ones apart from the “others” is an efficient, proven, and
        repeatable process that they follow for every ID project.

        What Is Instructional Design?
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-900 mb-6">
        The objective of providing instructions to learners is to ensure that,
        upon receiving and understanding those instructions, they (learners)
        acquire the necessary skills and knowledge covered by such instructions.
        Furthermore, the purpose of equipping learners with those skills is so
        they might apply what they’ve learned in the workplace.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-900 mb-6">
        In most cases, it’s unlikely that Learning and Development (L&D)
        professionals will accomplish the above objectives by simply providing
        verbal or written instructions. For example, knowledge transference and
        application won’t happen from bullet-point text or check lists. Success
        depends on the thoughtful design of instructions that target specific
        learning outcomes.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-900 mb-6">
        So, what is instructional design, and how does it further the objectives
        of knowledge transference and workplace application?

        Why Instructional Design?
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-900 mb-6">
        Without the aid of a well-defined instructional design system, the
        process of producing effective learning content relies on randomly
        executed tasks and steps. Often, trainers and instructors may think they
        know what to teach their audience; but in fact, that may not be what
        learners wish to learn! Even when L&D teams deal with well-understood
        training/learning objectives, an instructional designer, who does not
        embrace a proven ID process, risks creating ineffective instructional
        content.

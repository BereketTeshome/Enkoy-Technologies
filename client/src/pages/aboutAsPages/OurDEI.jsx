          <p cl>
            At ELM we take Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seriously. Research
            has shown organizations that implement DEI projects experience a
            boost in creative productivity. Latino/Americans, Asian Americans,
            Arab Americans, Black Americans, LGBTQ+ persons, and those with
            disabilities are all represented on our ELM team. Additionally, our
            workforce has a female representation of 75%, and our leadership
            team has a female representation of 70%. Through our partner
            Strategic Diversity Initiatives, LLC and our HR service provider
            Justworks, our team has received individualized training and
            coaching on allyship, dealing with ableism and disabilities,
            recognizing identities, and more.

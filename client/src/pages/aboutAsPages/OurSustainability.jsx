          ELM is committed to a more sustainable global workforce. We understand
          our impact goes beyond efforts within our own organization and we seek
          to encourage and support those actions for those we serve in the L&D
          community. As we partner with like-minded organizations, ELM utilizes
          a several-pronged approach to limit our impact on the environment
          while maximizing our obligation as L&D professionals and global
          citizens.

          By creating digital materials, ELM helps its clients reduce their
          reliance on paper goods and carbon-heavy shipping. Digital materials
          can be altered, updated, and delivered all without the past reliance
          on printed manuals that are often used once and discarded. Converting
          to digital content gives our clients the ability to completely remove
          the need for printing and encourages green delivery methods whenever
          possible. As an organization, ELM saves and preserves all files
          digitally rather than in print, reducing our own consumption of
          nonrenewable resources and reducing our overall waste output as much
          as possible.
